Dotfolio is not just a portfolio ‚Äî it‚Äôs a narrative, a space, an emotional experience disguised as an operating system.

Inspired by Mica aesthetics, this project blends creativity with code ‚Äî aiming to speak louder than words.

üß≠ Built entirely with [Compose Multiplatform](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform) ‚Äî using the WebAssembly + JS target.

## üåº Features

- üíª A static desktop environment that looks and feels like Windows 11 ‚Äî but minimal, soft, and handcrafted
- üñ±Ô∏è Fully interactive: a live clock, animated shortcuts, and a taskbar that reacts to opened apps
- üóÇÔ∏è Clickable desktop icons launch simulated apps like Notepad, Settings, a Media Player, Web Browser, and my CV
- üåó Seamless light and dark mode, and wallpaper customization option included
- üß† Each ‚Äúapp‚Äù is not just aesthetic ‚Äî it tells a part of the story: my skills, my personality, my design sense
- üåê Runs fully client-side, no backend, no trackers

> Dotfolio is structured like an operating system, but powered by storytelling. Just check it out:

## ü™ª Development Stage
### Main
- ‚úÖ Desktop Environment:
    - üå± Z Index for apps
    - ‚ùå Windows minimize capabilities
    - ‚ùå Windows dynamic size at launch based on the viewport

### Apps
- ‚úÖ Notepad
- ‚úÖ Settings
- ‚úÖ Photos
- ‚úÖ Media Player (Missing real audios)
- ‚úÖ Web Browser
- ‚úÖ File Manager
- ‚úÖ PDF file download (Missing real PDF)

### Bugs

<details>
<summary>Show/Hide</summary>

1. ### Windows are going under the shortcut icons, which doesn't make sense.

    Windows should be OVER any other element.

    This might mean that I will have to implement a Z index... bro
    I thought I could have made it without implementing that.

    I already tried to switch positions between DesktopEnvironment and DesktopShortcuts, but it's not that easy it seems.

2. ### When we open a second (or more) window, and we close the first one, the second window moves into the position where the first one was.
    Which doesn't make sense! Windows should have their position independent of other windows.

    I have no idea whatzupp with this and what it is causing it. I'll check on that later on when I finish coding all the "apps" inside dotfolio

3. ### Media player works seamlessly on web target, but in Desktop it has a bug in which if the audio is paused, then it cannot be played again.
    Although, it's okay. This project focuses on web target, and I use desktop implementation just for its hot reload capabilities, which really makes my life easier when quickly prototyping or fast debugging.

## üå∫ Goal of this project:

The sole goal is to stand out in a sea of traditional portfolios. It's to tell, build an interactive story about myself.

Taking this in mind, I focused on implementing only what is needed to tell this story, not to rebuild the actual functionality of an entire OS on Compose.

I consider this minimalist precision is not a limitation, but a design power move. Make it speak clearly, cleanly, and with purpose. That's my goal, and the one of this project.
