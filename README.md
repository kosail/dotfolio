A minimalist, interactive, Windows 11 themed developer portfolio built with [Compose Multiplatform](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform).  
Inspired by Mica aesthetics, this project blends creativity with code — aiming to speak louder than words.

> 📎 “Think of it as a personal OS. One that boots into who I am.”
