        Welcome!

        This isn't just a website — it's a simulation of a desktop environment.
        Built from scratch with Kotlin and Compose Multiplatform, running fully in your browser.

        You can double-click the icons on the left to open apps.
        Each one shows a piece of me — my projects, skills, story, and work.

        There’s no onboarding, no instructions. Just explore it as you would a real OS.
        Think of it as a tiny operating system, one that boots into who I am.

        Thank you for visiting.

        I once had a blog (or well said, I ran a blog for 4 years). It was called Mi lugar en el mundo (roughly translated as "My place in this world"). First on Tumblr, later on WordPress. I'll relaunch it in the future, maybe using Hugo (the static site generators written in Go) since I loved the simplicity of Markdown.

        It’s strange to think that eight long years have passed since I began studying Japanese—time slipping by so fast. I haven’t reached the highest level I once imagined I would by now.

        I’ve become a man. Older, stronger. Yet with little time left for myself.

        I wish I could go back. Get my hands dirty more often. Do things without doubting whether “I” could pull them off. Worry less about others. Worry less about myself.

        Even now, as a man—even with half of me made of regrets for the distant past—when I close my eyes and listen to old Takayan songs, I find myself grateful. Grateful for that silly kid who decided, all those years ago, to learn Japanese.

        This afternoon is for you. For your sweetness. For the shimmering voyage of your smile.

        Lately my favorite language is Kotlin, but I'm not a fan. Let me explain:

        I came from a Java background, so it felt like a natural upgrade. Same JVM under the hood but with built-in null safety, coroutines for smooth async, and (my favorite) Compose Multiplatform for writing one UI that actually runs on desktop, mobile, and web.

        That said, I don’t believe in golden hammers. Kotlin is great for apps, but it’s not what I reach for when I want to go low-level or mess with things like root services. For that, I’ve always had a soft spot for Go and C (it’s tough love tho, I just wish strings mem allocs in C didn’t feel like punishment).

        Then there’s C#. It honestly surprised me. I used to see it as “Microsoft Java,” but trying it out—especially alongside tools like LINQ, Power Apps, and Power BI—made me appreciate how polished and productive the ecosystem is, especially for building serious business apps fast. Sometimes it’s nice not to architect everything from scratch, and just focus on getting real things done.

        So yeah, I jump between stacks depending on the job. Languages are tools, and I don’t mind switching between screwdrivers and hammers as long as I’m building something useful. I care more about the craft, not the tools.

        Because a portfolio shouldn't feel like a résumé. It should feel like stepping into my brain. I didn’t want static links or an endless talk about "how great I am" or how I'm so confident about my skills, because I'm not. I wanted something playful, interactive, and deeply mine. A technical challenge to myself to prove you, and me, what I'm capable of.

        When people hear that I'm from Honduras I often get asked for Honduras delicacies, and I always talk about Baleadas.

        Oh man, a baleada is like a warm, comforting hug from Honduran street food. It's a soft, fluffy flour tortilla, fresh off the comal, stuffed with creamy refried beans, crumbled semi-seco cheese, and a drizzle of sweet-savory mantequilla (Honduran sour cream).

        The classic version is simple but so satisfying, though you can level it up with scrambled eggs, avocado, or even sliced plantains. Fold it in half, take a bite, and boom—pure happiness.

        I often find myself with a fuzzy feeling when I think of home and its cuisine.
